                    <p id="first_para_left_container">The Borodino-class battlecruisers were a group of four
                        battlecruisers
                        ordered by the Imperial Russian Navy before World War I for service with the Baltic Fleet.
                        Construction of the ships was delayed by a lack of capacity among domestic factories and the
                        need to
                        order some components from abroad. The start of the war in 1914 slowed their construction still
                        further. All of the ships were launched in 1915–1916, but it became evident that Russian
                        industry
                        would not be able to complete them during the war. The Russian Revolution of 1917 halted all
                        work on
                        the ships. Although some consideration was given to finishing the hulls that were nearest to
                        completion, they were all eventually sold for scrap by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Navy
                        proposed to
                        convert Izmail (pictured), the ship closest to completion, to an aircraft carrier in 1925, but
                        the
                        plan was cancelled after political manoeuvring by the Red Army led to funding not being
                        available.
